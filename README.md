# IDS705FinalProject

This is the repo for the Final Project of IDS 705 from Team 7.

## Road Signs Classification for Extreme Driving Conditions

- In this project, we aim to develop a model that can be deployed in a camera to identify and warn drivers of upcoming relevant signage in normal conditions as well as adverse weather conditions.
- We propose a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model which was built off the LeNet architecture to accurately classify signs and compare the performances across multiple datasets which include simulated adverse weather conditions. 
- The model utilizing a training dataset that contains only dark images yields the highest accuracy for normal and adverse conditions. Therefore using this model we can accurately identify and warn visually impaired drivers of road signs up ahead and prevent potential accidents.
